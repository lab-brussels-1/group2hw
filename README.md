<!-- describe your project -->

## Getting Started

<!-- a guide to using this repository -->

1. `git clone git@github.com:HackYourFutureBelgium/<project-name>.git`
2. `cd project-name`
3. `npm install`

## Code Quality Checks

- `npm run format`: Makes sure all the code in this repository is well-formatted
  (looks good).
- `npm run lint:ls`: Will lint the folder and file names in this repository to
  make sure they match the repo conventions.
- `npm run lint:md`: Will lint all of the Markdown files in this repository and
  let you know if there are any style mistakes to fix.
- `npm run spell-check`: Goes through all the files in this repository looking
  for words it doesn't recognize. Just because it says something is a mistake
  doesn't mean it is! It doesn't know every word in the world. You can add new
  correct words to the [./.cspell.json](./.cspell.json) file so they won't cause
  an error.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

When you open a PR to `main`/`master` in your repository, GitHub will
automatically do a linting check on the code in this repository, you can see
this in the[./.github/workflows/lint.yml](./.github/workflows/lint.yml) file.

If the linting fails, you will not be able to merge the PR. You can double check
that your code will pass before pushing by running `npm run lint:md` locally.

## Repo Setup

- Give each member _write_ access to the repo (if it's a group project)
- Turn on GitHub Pages and put a link to your website in the repo's description
- Turn on GitHub Actions
- in the _Branches_ section of your repo's settings make sure:
  - The repository
    [requires a review](https://github.blog/2018-03-23-require-multiple-reviewers/)
    before pull requests can be merged.
  - The `master`/`main` branch must "_Require status checks to pass before
    merging_"
  - The `master`/`main` branch must "_Require require branches to be up to date
    before merging_"
